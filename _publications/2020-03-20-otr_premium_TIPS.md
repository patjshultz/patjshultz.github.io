In this paper, yield spreads
between pairs of Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) with identical maturities
but of separate vintages are analyzed. Adjusting for differences in coupon rates and values of embedded deflation options, the results show a small, positive premium on recently
issued TIPS - averaging between one and four basis points - that persists even after new
similar TIPS are issued.
